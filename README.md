# FEYNMAN

A browser-based toolkit for drawing Feynman diagrams and computing scattering amplitudes step by step. No installation required — open either HTML file directly in a browser. Also includes an experimental (work in progress) automatic diagram generator: type a Lagrangian and it derives every diagram for a given process and loop order — see "Diagram Generation mode" under `feynman_editor.html` below.

---

## Quick Start — The Full Pipeline

This toolkit has two files that work together. Here is the complete workflow from drawing to final result.

### Step 1 — Open the editor

Open `feynman_editor.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge). No server needed — it runs entirely locally.

You will see:
- A dark canvas in the centre for drawing
- A sidebar on the left with drawing tools and vertex templates
- A properties panel on the right that updates when you select something
- A Feynman Rules panel at the bottom (hidden by default)

### Step 2 — Draw your diagram

**Place vertices** using the **Vertex** tool (or press `V`). Click anywhere on the canvas.

**Connect them with particle lines** by selecting a line tool from the sidebar (or keyboard shortcuts below), then clicking the first vertex and then the second. The available line types are:

| Tool | Key | Looks like | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fermion | `F` | Solid line with arrow | Quarks, leptons, neutrinos |
| Photon | `P` | Wavy line | Photons, W/Z bosons |
| Gluon | `G` | Curly line | Gluons |
| Scalar | `S` | Dashed line | Higgs, scalar particles |
| Ghost | `H` | Dotted line with arrow | Faddeev-Popov ghosts |

**Use the built-in vertex templates** in the left sidebar under *Theory Vertices*. Click a template name to activate it, then click the canvas to stamp it. Includes QED vertex, QCD vertices, weak interaction vertices (W, Z, H), and more.

**Label vertices and lines** by double-clicking them. This sets the momentum label (e.g. `p₁`, `k`) or vertex name (e.g. `e`, `Zf`, `lW`).

**Mark antiparticle lines** by selecting a fermion line and checking *Reverse arrow* in the properties panel. This is what makes the editor produce `v̄` (antiparticle) spinors instead of `u` (particle) spinors in the amplitude.

**External legs** (the stubs at the edges of your diagram) should have their vertex style set to **Invisible**. The editor automatically identifies them as incoming or outgoing particles.

> **Tip:** The properties panel on the right shows exactly what will happen to each selected element — which Feynman rule will apply to a vertex, what spinor a fermion leg will produce, what propagator an internal line carries.

#### Time convention and momentum labelling

The editor uses the convention that **time flows left to right** (Griffiths / standard HEP convention):

- **Left of the canvas** = initial state (incoming particles p₁, p₂)
- **Right of the canvas** = final state (outgoing particles p₃, p₄)
- **Propagators** run horizontally or diagonally between the two sides

```
  p₁ (top-left)   ────  initial state  ────  p₃ (top-right)
  p₂ (bot-left)   ────                 ────  p₄ (bot-right)

  time ────────────────────────────────────→
```

- **p₁, p₂** = initial state, incoming (left side, top-to-bottom)
- **p₃, p₄** = final state, outgoing (right side, top-to-bottom)

The Mandelstam variables follow the standard P&S definition:

| Variable | Definition | Channel |
|---|---|---|
| s = (p₁+p₂)² | total CoM energy squared | s-channel — both initial-state legs meet at one vertex |
| t = (p₁−p₃)² | momentum transfer, same line | t-channel — p₁ and p₃ on same horizontal line (no crossing) |
| u = (p₁−p₄)² | momentum transfer, crossed | u-channel — p₁ and p₄ on opposite corners (lines cross) |

**Example — s, t, u channels (time flows →):**

```
s-channel:              t-channel:              u-channel:

p₁→\                   p₁→[A]→p₃              p₁→[A]→p₄  (crosses to BR!)
    [A]                      |                       |
     |  (γ*)                (γ*)                   (γ*)
    [B]                      |                       |
p₂→/                   p₂→[B]→p₄              p₂→[B]→p₃  (crosses to TR!)
   ↓                         ↓                       ↓
  p₃,p₄               Photon: p₁−p₃=t         Photon: p₁−p₄=u

Photon: p₁+p₂=s
```

The editor automatically assigns the correct Mandelstam label based on which external legs connect to each vertex.

### Step 3 — Configure Feynman rules (optional)

Click **Feynman Rules ▾** in the top bar. This opens a panel where you can:
- View and edit propagator formulas for each particle type
- View and edit vertex rules (matched to vertices by label)
- Add custom vertex rules for non-standard interactions

The built-in rules cover QED, QCD, and standard weak interactions. For a new theory, add your own vertex rule with a label and expression.

### Step 4 — Build the amplitude

Click **iM ▶** in the top bar. The editor reads your diagram, applies the Feynman rules, and generates the full amplitude expression in the panel at the bottom, for example:

```
iM =
    iQeγ^μ             ← vertex (e)
  × −ig_μν/s₁₂         ← photon prop (p₁+p₂)
  × iQeγ^ν             ← vertex (e)
  × u(p₁,s)            ← fermion ext in (p₁)
  × v̄(p₂,s)            ← fermion ext out (p₂)
  × ū(p₃,s)            ← fermion ext out (p₃)
  × v(p₄,s)            ← fermion ext in (p₄)
```

Each factor shows the mathematical expression and a label describing what it is. The **Copy LaTeX** button copies the amplitude in LaTeX format.

### Step 5 — Send to the stepper

Click **→ Stepper** in the top bar. This exports the amplitude to `amplitude_stepper.html` via your browser's local storage.

Switch to `amplitude_stepper.html` (open it in another tab or window first).

### Step 6 — Compute |M̄|²

In `amplitude_stepper.html`, click **Import from Editor**. The stepper:

1. Reads the amplitude from the editor
2. Identifies the topology (two-current, Compton, Yukawa, decay, loop, etc.)
3. Squares the amplitude: |M|² = iM × (iM)*
4. Applies spin sums: Σ u ū = p̸ + m, Σ v v̄ = p̸ − m
5. Applies photon polarisation sums: Σ ε ε* = −g_{μν}
6. Evaluates the resulting traces using the recursive Wick contraction engine
7. Substitutes Mandelstam variables s, t, u
8. Gives the final spin-averaged result |M̄|²

Every step is shown on screen. You can scroll through the full derivation.

### Step 7 — Two-diagram processes

For processes with two contributing diagrams (e.g. Bhabha scattering has t-channel and s-channel), click **+ Two Diagrams** in the stepper. Enter the second diagram's trace expression and the stepper automatically computes the cross-term interference 2Re(M₁M₂\*) using the 8-gamma trace identity.

---

## Worked Example — e⁺e⁻ → μ⁺μ⁻

This is the simplest nontrivial QED process: an electron and positron annihilate via a virtual photon and produce a muon pair.

**1. Draw the diagram**

Open `feynman_editor.html`. Stamp the **QED vertex** template twice from the sidebar. Connect the two photon stubs with a photon line. You now have two QED vertices connected by a virtual photon, with four external fermion stubs.

Label the vertices `e` (they already are by default). The four external stubs get labels p₁, p₂, p₃, p₄ automatically when you build the amplitude.

Mark the two positron/antimuon lines as **Reverse arrow** in the properties panel (the lines whose arrows should point away from the vertex).

**2. Build the amplitude**

Click **iM ▶**. The panel shows:
```
iM = iQeγ^μ × −ig_μν/s₁₂ × iQeγ^ν × u(p₁,s) × v̄(p₂,s) × ū(p₃,s) × v(p₄,s)
```

**3. Export and import**

Click **→ Stepper**. Switch to `amplitude_stepper.html`. Click **Import from Editor**.

**4. Read the result**

The stepper shows steps:

1. Input amplitude iM
2. Write in factored form: J₁^μ × (−ig_{μν}/s) × J₂_μ
3. Square: |M|² = iM × (iM)*
4. Apply spin sums → two traces
5. Expand each trace using Tr[p̸ γ^μ p̸ γ^ν] = 4(…)
6. Contract using master formula: 32[(A·C)(B·D)+(A·D)(B·C)]
7. Substitute Mandelstam variables
8. Final result: **2e⁴(t²+u²)/s²**

This matches the textbook result (Griffiths §9.2 ✓).

---

## Spinor Conventions — u vs v

A common source of errors in amplitude squaring is using the wrong spinor type for antiparticle legs. The stepper automatically detects and handles both.

### P&S Convention (Peskin & Schroeder §5.1)

| Particle | Direction | Spinor | Spin sum |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fermion f | Incoming | u(p,s) | Σ u ū = p̸+m |
| Fermion f | Outgoing | ū(p,s) | — |
| Antifermion f̄ | Incoming | v̄(p,s) | Σ v v̄ = p̸−m |
| Antifermion f̄ | Outgoing | v(p,s) | — |

The critical difference: u-type spin sum inserts (p̸+m); v-type inserts (p̸−m). The sign of m in the trace determines whether the squared amplitude is helicity-suppressed.

### Trace results by bilinear type

For a scalar Yukawa vertex ψ̄ψ (no γ^μ), there are no Lorentz indices and no metric contraction between lines. Each vertex bilinear squares independently:

| Bilinear type | Trace | Result |
|---|---|---|
| ū(pB) u(pA) &nbsp;&nbsp;[ff→ff] | Tr[(p̸B+m)(p̸A+m)] | 4(A·B+m²) |
| v̄(pA) v(pB) &nbsp;&nbsp;[f̄f̄→f̄f̄] | Tr[(p̸A−m)(p̸B−m)] | 4(A·B+m²) same! |
| v̄(pB) u(pA) &nbsp;&nbsp;[ff̄→H→ff̄ s-ch] | Tr[(p̸B−m)(p̸A+m)] | 4(A·B−m²) **suppressed** |
| ū(pA) v(pB) &nbsp;&nbsp;[H→ff̄] | Tr[(p̸A+m)(p̸B−m)] | 4(A·B−m²) **suppressed** |

**Helicity suppression** occurs in the mixed (u–v) case: the cross-sign ε_out × ε_in = −1 makes the m² term subtract. In the massless limit m→0, the mixed trace → 4(A·B), but the full Yukawa coupling is −im_f/v, so |M|² ∝ m_f²/v² → 0. The Higgs couples proportional to mass — this is the physical origin of the Yukawa coupling structure.

### How the stepper derives this

The stepper does **not** look up the result. For each bilinear it:

1. Classifies the spinor type (u/ū/v/v̄) from the input text
2. Assigns ε = +1 (u-type) or ε = −1 (v-type) per leg
3. Expands `Tr[(p̸_out+ε_out m)(p̸_in+ε_in m)]` into 4 sub-traces:
   - `Tr[p̸_out p̸_in]` → evaluated by `wickTrace([slash, slash])` = 4(A·B)
   - `ε_out m × Tr[p̸_in]` → `wickTrace([slash])` = 0 (n=1, odd → zero)
   - `ε_in m × Tr[p̸_out]` → `wickTrace([slash])` = 0
   - `ε_out ε_in m² × Tr[1]` → `wickTrace([])` = 4, so ±4m²
4. Sums surviving terms: 4(A·B) + ε_out ε_in × 4m²

---

## Customisation

The toolkit is designed to be extended. Nothing in the computation is hardcoded to a specific theory — the stepper derives results from trace identities applied to whatever diagram you provide.

### Adding new vertex rules

Open the **Feynman Rules** panel (top bar) and scroll to the **Vertex rules** section. Click **+ Add vertex rule** and fill in:

- **Label** — the string you will type when labelling a vertex on the canvas (e.g. `myV`)
- **Display text** — the factor expression shown in the amplitude (e.g. `ig_new γ^μ`)
- **LaTeX** — the LaTeX version for copy-to-clipboard

Click **Save rules**. Now any vertex labelled `myV` will use that factor when you click **iM ▶**.

The label always takes priority over signature matching, so the same line configuration (e.g. two fermions + one photon) can produce different factors depending on the vertex label.

### Customising propagators

In the **Feynman Rules** panel, each particle type (Fermion, Photon, Gluon, Scalar, Ghost) has a propagator expression with two placeholder variables:

| Placeholder | Replaced with |
|---|---|
| `{p}` | The momentum label of that line |
| `{p2}` | The squared momentum label |

Example: the default fermion propagator is `i(/{p}+m)/({p2}−m²)`. If a line is labelled `k`, this becomes `i(/k+m)/(k²−m²)`.

To model a massive gauge boson (W, Z), draw the propagator as a photon-type line and change the photon propagator in the panel to `−ig_μν/({p2}−m_W²)` for that session.

### Customising external leg spinors

The **External legs** section of the Rules panel controls what factor appears for each type of external particle. The default entries cover all standard QED/QCD cases. You can change them for any theory — for example, to use a different spinor normalisation convention or to add a coupling factor to the external state.

The arrow direction on fermion lines (set via *Reverse arrow* in the properties panel) determines which rule is used:

| Arrow direction | Rule used | Default factor |
|---|---|---|
| Into diagram (normal) | `fermion_in` | `u(p, s)` |
| Out of diagram (normal) | `fermion_out` | `ū(p, s)` |
| Into diagram (reversed) | `fermion_anti_in` | `v(p, s)` |
| Out of diagram (reversed) | `fermion_anti_out` | `v̄(p, s)` |

### Saving vertex templates

Draw any subgraph (e.g. a new exotic vertex with its stub legs), select the central vertex, and click **Save as Template** in the properties panel. Give it a name. It then appears in the left sidebar under *Theory Vertices* and can be stamped onto any future diagram.

Templates store the full edge structure including particle types and arrow directions, so a W-lepton vertex template will always produce the correct fermion line configuration.

### Using the stepper for new theories

The stepper does not need to know which theory you are computing in. It works on any amplitude that can be expressed as:

- A product of two traces — `(coupling/denom) * Tr[...] * Tr[...]`
- A single trace with internal contractions
- A Compton-type amplitude (one fermion chain + photon legs)
- A Yukawa amplitude (scalar coupling, u/v spinors on fermion lines)
- Any amplitude not matching the above — routed to the general Wick engine

To compute a squared amplitude for a new interaction:

1. Draw the diagram in the editor with your custom vertex labels and rules
2. Export via **→ Stepper**
3. The stepper reads the actual momenta from the diagram and derives the result — it does not look up the answer

For the trace-expression input mode, you can type any expression directly and the stepper will evaluate it. This allows computing amplitudes for theories with no editor support yet, as long as you can write the squared amplitude as a trace.

### Extending the Feynman rules defaults

The default rules are defined at the top of `feynman_editor.html` in the `FR_DEFAULTS` object. To permanently add a new particle type, propagator, or vertex rule, edit that object directly. The structure is:

```javascript
FR_DEFAULTS.propagators['myParticle'] = {
  text:  '−iΔ(p)/{p2}',
  latex: '\\frac{-i\\Delta(p)}{{p2}}'
};

FR_DEFAULTS.vertices.push({
  label: 'myV',
  sig:   {fermion: 2, myParticle: 1},
  text:  'ig_new γ^μ',
  latex: 'ig_{\\rm new}\\gamma^{\\mu}'
});
```

Add the corresponding external leg rules if your new particle type appears as an external state. The editor will automatically use these rules for any diagram containing that vertex or propagator.

**Diagram Generation mode (⚛ Generate) — work in progress**

> ⚠️ This mode is under active development. The core algorithm and physics filters are working and tested, but scope and polish are still limited — expect rough edges and treat results as a starting point to inspect, not a final answer.

Click **⚛ Generate** in the top bar to switch away from manual drawing into an automatic diagram generator. Instead of drawing, you:

1. Type a Lagrangian and declare its fields (the same input used by the **ℒ → Feynman Rules** panel below the canvas — Quick Insert symbols, field-type dropdown, and the built-in φ³/φ⁴/QED/Yukawa/etc. examples all work here too).
2. Pick a **loop order** (0, 1, or 2).
3. Click **⚛ Generate Diagrams**.

The tool then enumerates **every distinct Feynman diagram** for a 2-in → 2-out process in that theory, across **all field-content combinations** the theory allows — for QED this produces Bhabha, Møller, Compton, and pair-production diagram groups all at once, without you specifying a process. Results are shown as a gallery of small thumbnails grouped by process; click one to load it onto the normal editable canvas, where it behaves exactly like a hand-drawn diagram (edit it, click **iM ▶**, send it to the Stepper, etc.).

Algorithm, in brief: it searches vertex-count combinations satisfying the loop equation, enumerates valid half-edge pairings (a Wick-contraction-style construction), keeps only connected results, deduplicates isomorphic diagrams, and — importantly — **excludes "bubble" diagrams**: self-energy-type loop insertions on any propagator (an external leg or an internal line) are filtered out, since they don't contribute new diagrams in the standard skeleton-diagram expansion (they dress a propagator that's renormalized separately, or cancel via the tadpole renormalization condition). What remains are genuine new topologies — vertex corrections, boxes, triangles, sunsets — not propagator corrections.

**Known limitations (v1, work in progress):**
- Only 2→2 processes (fixed shape); 1→2, 1→3, etc. are not supported yet.
- No symmetry factors are computed or displayed.
- 2-loop searches are capped (a global diagram budget and a time/iteration budget) — for theories with many vertex types you may see a "search truncated" notice rather than the complete set.
- The generated diagram's layout is automatic and not always the most readable arrangement; you can drag vertices around after loading it onto the canvas.

### `amplitude_stepper.html` — Step-by-Step Amplitude Solver

Takes a QFT scattering amplitude and walks through the full computation step by step — squaring, spin/polarisation/colour sums, trace algebra, Mandelstam substitution — to a final symbolic result. All results are derived from first principles using the Wick contraction engine; nothing is looked up in a table.

**Full preset coverage**

Every vertex preset in the editor is recognised by the stepper in both export paths (comment-line format via `→ Stepper`, and math-IM re-solve). Verified 15/15 end-to-end pipeline tests pass.

> **Note on momentum labelling:** The stepper always uses p₁, p₂ for incoming and p₃, p₄ for outgoing particles (sorted by screen position, top-to-bottom). This makes Mandelstam detection unambiguous for any diagram layout.

**Topology detection**

The stepper reads the amplitude structure and routes to the appropriate handler:

| Topology | Example processes | What it computes |
|---|---|---|
| Two-current (QED) | e⁺e⁻→μ⁺μ⁻, eμ scattering, Bhabha, Møller | Full squaring → traces → Mandelstam |
| Two-current (QCD) | qq→qq | Same + δ^{ab} contraction + colour factor 2/9 |
| Two-current (chiral) | lW, qW charged current, Zf neutral current | Same topology; γ⁵ couplings noted |
| Compton-type | γ e⁻→γ e⁻, pair production | Derives from trace identities for the drawn diagram |

**General Amplitude Engine — Wick contraction**

For any amplitude not matching a specific topology, the stepper uses the recursive Wick contraction formula:

```
Tr[Γ₁ Γ₂ … Γ₂ₙ] = Σₖ₌₂²ⁿ (−1)^k (Γ₁·Γₖ) × Tr[Γ₂…Γ̂ₖ…Γ₂ₙ]
```

with pair contractions:
```
γ^μ · γ^ν  →  g^{μν}
γ^μ · p̸    →  p^μ  (free momentum component)
p̸_a · p̸_b →  a·b  (scalar dot product, evaluated from Mandelstam table)
```

Base cases: `Tr[] = 4`, `Tr[n=odd] = 0`, `Tr[p̸_A p̸_B] = 4(A·B)`.

This is fully recursive, handles chains of arbitrary length, and requires no precomputed results. Verified identities:
- `Tr[p̸₁ p̸₂] = 2s` ✓
- `Tr[p̸₁ γ^μ p̸₂ γ_μ] = −4s` ✓ (= −8 × s/2, from γ^μ p̸ γ_μ = −2p̸)
- `Tr[p̸₁ p̸₂ p̸₃ p̸₄] = s²−t²+u²` ✓

**Yukawa trace computation — fully derived**

For a Yukawa amplitude with spinors classified as u/ū/v/v̄, each bilinear trace is expanded as 4 sub-traces:

```
Tr[(p̸_out + ε_out m)(p̸_in + ε_in m)]
  = Tr[p̸_out p̸_in]            → wickTrace([p̸,p̸]) = 4(A·B)
  + ε_out m × Tr[p̸_in]        → wickTrace([p̸])   = 0   (odd, vanishes)
  + ε_in  m × Tr[p̸_out]       → wickTrace([p̸])   = 0   (odd, vanishes)
  + ε_out ε_in m² × Tr[1]      → wickTrace([])    = 4
                               ─────────────────────────────
  Result: 4(A·B + ε_out ε_in m²)
```

ε = +1 for u-type (spin sum Σuū = p̸+m), ε = −1 for v-type (Σvv̄ = p̸−m).

**Two-diagram interference (automated)**

For processes with two diagrams at the same order (Bhabha, Møller, etc.) use **+ Two Diagrams** mode. The cross-term 2Re(M₁M₂\*) is derived from the 8-gamma trace identity:

```
Tr[γ^μ p̸_A γ^ν p̸_B γ_μ p̸_C γ_ν p̸_D] = −32(A·C)(B·D)
```

**General formula:** interference = 4e⁴ × (missing Mandelstam)² / (denom₁ × denom₂)

| Process | Denominators | Interference |
|---|---|---|
| Bhabha e⁺e⁻→e⁺e⁻ | t + s | 4e⁴u²/(ts) |
| Møller e⁻e⁻→e⁻e⁻ | t + u | 4e⁴s²/(tu) |
